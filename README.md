Motor Imagery implementation using Python 3 

## The Real_time folder 

The Real-time contains two Python 3 scripts which are used to run the classifier training and prediction

The Real_time_data_collection_and_classifier_training script is used to train the classifier when combined with the openvibe scenario from the Openvibe folder. The Real_time_output_prediction script is used to allow real-time classification using the pretrained classifiers from the previously mentioned script. All other scripts found in the Real_time folder as well as the Classification and Laplacian_filter scripts found in the main folder of the project are used by these two main scripts.
